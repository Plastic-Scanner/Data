# How the data was collected
All made in a single day, on the 31st of May 2022
Measurements taken with DB2.1 board #01 and #03
## Installed LEDâ€™s: 

|Wavelength (nm) |940 |1050 |1200 |1300 |1460 |1550 |1650 |1720 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Current limiting resistor (Î©) |200 |150 |240 |240 |150 |150 |40 |130 |

Firmware version: used the firmware in this state: https://github.com/Plastic-Scanner/DB2.x-Firmware/tree/d3c327b010a1d05257fe97519fa377fe8ecc6a79

Spectraplot version: used the software in this state:
https://github.com/Plastic-Scanner/PSplot/tree/bea524f7bcbdfb529c8c889efb674bfaf6252db4


Workflow:
- Sample is chosen at random from bag of clean samples
- Sample is placed on #01 board
- Lid is closed
- Spectraplot asks the board to scan 5 times with 1 second interval
- Lid is opened
- Sample is moved to #03 board
- Lid is closed
- Spectraplot asks the board to scan 5 times with 1 second interval
- Lid is opened
- Sample is placed in photobooth for picture

## Filenaming  
0-99 series is PP.  
100-199 series is PET.  
200-299 series is HDPE.  
300-399 series is PS.  
900-999 series is unknowns, can be anthing like ABS, PLA, POM or plastics that are missing marking.other items that do not have this naming have the plastic type in the name itself.

## How the data is structured
![overviewdata](img/overviewdata.png)
Data is structured like thisðŸ‘†, it starts with a spectralon sample, to have a flat reference response curve.
All the values are raw from the microcontroller, so they should be calibrated with the spectralon measurements if you want to compare the results from #01 board to the #03 board 
Remarks on data:
In the folder "img" there is a picture of each plastic sample

## How to process the data
Feel free to use your magic platform and code to start processing the data, but try to keep it as reproducible and understandable as possible. A good suggestion is Google Colab which can be commented on and runs in the cloud, so you don't need to install anything on your computer.
