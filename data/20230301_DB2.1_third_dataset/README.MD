Workflow:
- first spectralon and polished aluminium reference sample was measured
- substiture for spectralons was measured (ID name: thorlabs)
- Samples from the Reference material box C were used
- Each sample was measured 4x times at different places on the sample
- Thorlabs material was used as a backing material
- a 123 block was used as a downward force to make a good connection between sample and sensor module
